### Hi there 👋

I'm Maria, formerly an Architect and Project manager, and I decided to apply my creativity and problem-solving skills to the tech world. 

- I’m currently working on some personal projects to learn new skills.
- I've worked as a Product Manager in a Fintech (B2B SaaS) and E-commerce.
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects which I can improve, make new friends and learn more about AI, coding and blockchain.

😍 Hobbies/ Fun Facts 🤪:

- 👩🏽‍🍳 Cooking: Love to cook and bake, and do some experiement on the kitchen 🧪 
-  Sports in general and Love Handball 
-  Crazy about plants, I'm creating a forest at home, they are my babies! 🪴
-  Love travelling and know new cultures (lived in Brazil, Germany, France and in the UK) and currently I speak four and a half languages.
- ⚡ I'm a brazilian architect 🇧🇷, who worked as Project Manager in London, love investments and motivated to start a career in the tech industry.  

Nice to meet you!
